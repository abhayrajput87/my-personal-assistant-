This script is a simple virtual assistant that uses voice recognition to perform various tasks. It utilizes the following libraries: SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, pyjokes, time, os, requests, and json.

The script is designed to perform basic tasks such as playing music on YouTube, telling the time, searching Wikipedia for information about a person, telling jokes, and opening certain apps such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google Chrome.

To use this script, you must have a microphone and the necessary libraries installed. Simply run the script and say a command to activate the virtual assistant. The virtual assistant will then perform the corresponding task based on the command.

Note that the virtual assistant responds to the name "Alexa". To exit the program, say "Alexa stop" or "Alexa exit".

Overall, this is a simple and useful virtual assistant that can be customized to perform additional tasks based on the needs of the user.
